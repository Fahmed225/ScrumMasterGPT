    "text": "Good tips from chatgpt \n\nDealing with a potential client who is enthusiastic but hesitant to sign a contract can be challenging. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n1. **Understanding Concerns**: Ask open-ended questions to understand their concerns. There might be specific clauses or terms in the contract they are unsure about.\n1. **Flexibility and Patience**: Show flexibility and patience. Pressuring the client might lead to a negative outcome. Reassure them that you're available to address any concerns.\n1. **Follow-up Meetings**: Schedule a follow-up meeting specifically to discuss the contract. This dedicated time helps ensure they have reviewed it and can discuss any issues.\n1. **Simplify the Contract**: Review the contract to ensure it's clear and concise. Complex contracts can be intimidating. Simplifying it might help the client feel more comfortable.\n1. **Offer References or Case Studies**: Providing examples of successful partnerships or testimonials from satisfied clients can build trust and alleviate concerns.\n1. **Negotiate Terms**: Be open to negotiating terms that might be causing hesitation. A small compromise can often lead to a signed agreement.\n1. **Set a Gentle Deadline**: Suggest a reasonable deadline for signing the contract. This creates a sense of urgency without being pushy.\n1. **Involve a Senior Team Member**: Sometimes involvement from a senior team member in discussions can provide the client with the reassurance they need.\n1. **Regular Communication**: Maintain regular communication and provide updates about your services, changes, or improvements that might interest them.\n1. **Prepare to Walk Away**: If all efforts fail, be prepared to walk away respectfully. Sometimes this can prompt action from the client, or it might just be the best decision for both parties.\nIt's important to balance persistence with respect for the client\u2019s decision-making process. Remember, every client is different, and what works for one might not work for another.",

    "text": "<@U06370GMA8M> here is some verbiage drafted up by GPT4 regarding SLAs for feature requests and bug fixes. Please review:\n\n```Please note, the specific language and structure of contract clauses may vary depending on jurisdiction and should be drafted or reviewed by a legal professional before inclusion in a contract. Below is illustrative language that you might consider incorporating into a contract for mobile app development pertaining to service level agreements (SLAs) for bug fixes and feature requests:\n\n---\n\n**Section [X]: Maintenance and Support**\n\n1. **Definitions**\n\n   a. \"Bug\" shall mean a defect, error, or flaw in the Software that causes it to fail to execute its programming instructions resulting in an incorrect or unexpected result, or to become inoperative.\n   \n   b. \"Critical Bug\" refers to a Bug that:\n      i. Causes a total system outage or significant feature inoperability,\n      ii. Cannot be reasonably circumvented by the Client, and\n      iii. Directly impacts the business operations or security of the Client.\n   \n   c. \"Feature Request\" shall mean a request by the Client for modifications, enhancements, or additions to the Software that provide new functionality or improvements not available in the current version of the Software.\n\n2. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**\n\n   a. The Developer agrees to adhere to the following SLA for the resolution of Bugs reported by the Client:\n      i. Critical Bugs will be addressed within 24 hours of notification by the Client with an initial response and assessment. A resolution or suitable workaround must be provided within 72 hours;\n      ii. High Priority Bugs will be addressed within 48 hours with an initial response, and a resolution must be provided within 5 business days;\n      iii. Medium Priority Bugs will be addressed within 5 business days with an initial response, and a resolution must be provided within 10 business days;\n      iv. Low Priority Bugs will be addressed within 10 business days with an initial response, and a resolution timeframe will be mutually agreed upon between the Developer and the Client.\n\n   b. The Developer agrees to the following SLA for addressing Feature Requests:\n      i. The Developer will provide an initial assessment and feasibility response for any Feature Request within 10 business days of receipt;\n      ii. If the Feature Request is deemed feasible and within the scope of the Developer's capabilities, the Developer and the Client will discuss and agree upon a timeline and cost estimate for the implementation of the Feature Request.\n\n3. **Support Procedure**\n\n   a. The Client shall report any Bugs or submit Feature Requests through [designated support channels] in accordance with the procedures outlined in this agreement.\n   \n   b. The Developer will use reasonable efforts to provide the Client with email and/or telephone support during the Developer's regular business hours.\n\n4. **Quality Assurance**\n\n   a. The Developer will conduct appropriate quality assurance testing on all fixes and updates to ensure that they do not introduce new Bugs into the Software.\n   \n   b. The Developer ensures that all new Features that are developed and added to the Software through this SLA will be fully integrated and functional within the existing Software environment.\n\n5. **Exclusions**\n\n   a. The SLA does not apply to issues resulting from:\n      i. Use of the Software in a manner not authorized or contemplated by the applicable documentation or this Agreement;\n      ii. Modifications, alterations, or add-ons to the Software made by parties other than the Developer, unless officially authorized;\n      iii. The Client's failure to install updates or patches provided by the Developer in a timely manner.\n\n---\n\nThis draft language is meant to provide the foundation for discussion and negotiation and should be tailored to the specific needs or circumstances of your agreement. Before finalizing your contract, it is advisable to consult with a legal advisor experienced in software development contracts.```\nCC <@U063NC344KB>",
